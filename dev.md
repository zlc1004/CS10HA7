# Cybersecurity | CS10HA7 Part B

## New Technology

### What is cybersecurity all about?

Cybersecurity is the practice of protecting systems, networks, and programs from digital attacks. These cyberattacks are usually aimed at accessing, changing, or destroying sensitive information; extorting money from users through ransomware; or interrupting normal business processes.

Implementing effective cybersecurity measures is particularly challenging today because there are more devices than people, and attackers are becoming more innovative.

A successful cybersecurity posture has multiple layers of protection spread across the computers, networks, programs, or data that one intends to keep safe. In an organization, a unified threat management gateway system can automate integrations across products and accelerate key security operations functions: detection, investigation, and remediation. People, processes, and technology must all complement one another to create an effective defense from cyberattacks.

#### People

Users must understand and comply with basic data protection and privacy security principles like choosing strong passwords, being wary of attachments in email, and backing up data.

#### Processes

Organizations must have a framework for how they deal with both attempted and successful cyberattacks, like installing antivirus, and backing up data.

### Why is cybersecurity important?

At an individual level, a cybersecurity attack can result in everything from identity theft to extortion attempts, to the loss of important data like family photos. Everyone relies on critical infrastructure like power plants, hospitals, and financial service companies. Securing these and other organizations is essential to keeping our society functioning.

## Core Competencies

The Core Competencies are sets of intellectual, personal, and social and emotional proficiencies that all students need in order to engage in deep, lifelong learning. Along with literacy and numeracy foundations, they are central to British Columbia's K-12 curriculum and assessment system and directly support students in their growth as educated citizens.

Students develop Core Competencies when they are engaged in the “doing” - the Curricular Competencies - within a learning area. As such, they are an integral part of the curriculum. While they manifest themselves uniquely in each area of learning, the Core Competencies are often interconnected and are foundational to all learning.

Before students enter school, development of Core Competencies begins at home and then continues throughout their life. Students encounter opportunities to develop their competence in formal and informal settings. They move from demonstrating competence in relatively simple and highly supported situations, to demonstrating independence in more complex and varied contexts. Competency development does not end with school graduation but continues in personal, social, educational, and workplace contexts.

Students, teachers, and parents/guardians share responsibility for the ongoing development of Core Competencies. Each group has its own considerations.

- Discussing the Core Competencies with peers, teachers, and family can deepen students' understanding of the Core Competencies and help them identify personal strengths and establish goals for further development as educated citizens
- Examining the illustrations helps students develop an appreciation of the different ways, forms, and contexts in which the Core Competencies can be applied
- The illustrations connect the Core Competencies with students' own classroom experiences and bring the profiles to life for them
- Students are responsible for assessing their own growth in the Core Competencies. The profiles linked with each sub-competency can serve as a helpful guide in this self-assessment

- Teachers can use the sub-competency profiles and illustrations to support students in their growth as educated citizens
- Providing students with meaningful tasks and activities, where they can explicitly reflect on where and how they are using the Core Competencies, will further their development in Communication, Thinking, and Personal and Social. The illustrations for each sub-competency provide examples of rich tasks, activities, and feedback
- The Core Competencies are embedded within the curriculum and are naturally supported when students engage with the Big Ideas and Curricular Competencies in each area of learning. Examples of explicit connections with Big Ideas can be found in the “Connection” section for each sub-competency
- Teachers support students in assessing their own growth in the Core Competencies. (For more information on assessment and the Core Competencies, please see [Classroom Assessment and Reporting](https://curriculum.gov.bc.ca/classroom-assessment))

- Students develop Core Competencies at home as well as at school, making parent/guardian support for students' growing awareness, understanding, and development of the Core Competencies crucial
- Parents/guardians will likely already have some understanding of their students' development in Communication, Thinking, and Personal and Social
- Formal school tasks and activities often look different from the more informal tasks students are involved in at home. While both contexts are valuable, parents/guardians can expect that a student's use of the Core Competencies may look very different in these two contexts
- The illustrations offer examples from a variety of contexts and can provide parents/guardians with a new lens through which to view their students' development as educated citizens

## Unpacking the three Core Competencies

[Communication](#communication)

[Thinking](#thinking)

[Personal and Social](#personal-and-social)

![Communication](https://curriculum.gov.bc.ca/sites/curriculum.gov.bc.ca/files/images/competencies/core_comp_c_orange.png)

![Thinking](https://curriculum.gov.bc.ca/sites/curriculum.gov.bc.ca/files/images/competencies/core_comp_t_blue.png)

![Personal and Social](https://curriculum.gov.bc.ca/sites/curriculum.gov.bc.ca/files/images/competencies/core_comp_ps_green.png)

The Communication competency encompasses the knowledge, skills, processes and dispositions we associate with interactions with others. Through their communication, students acquire, develop and transform ideas and information, and make connections with others to share their ideas, express their individuality, further their learning, and get things done. The communication competency is fundamental to finding satisfaction, purpose and joy.

The Thinking competency encompasses the knowledge, skills and processes we associate with intellectual development. It is through their competency as thinkers that students take subject-specific concepts and content and transform them into a new understanding. Thinking competence includes specific thinking skills as well as habits of mind, and metacognitive awareness. These are used to process information from a variety of sources, including thoughts and feelings that arise from the subconscious and unconscious mind and from embodied cognition, to create new understandings.

The Personal and Social competency is the set of abilities that relate to students' identity in the world, both as individuals and as members of their community and society. Personal and social competency encompasses what students need to thrive as individuals, to understand and care about themselves and others, and to find and achieve their purposes in the world.

### [Communication](https://curriculum.gov.bc.ca/competencies/communication)

- **Definition**

> The Communication competency encompasses the knowledge, skills, processes and dispositions we associate with interactions with others. Through their communication, students acquire, develop and transform ideas and information, and make connections with others to share their ideas, express their individuality, further their learning, and get things done. The communication competency is fundamental to finding satisfaction, purpose and joy.

The Communication Core Competency has two interrelated sub-competencies:

### [Communicating](https://curriculum.gov.bc.ca/competencies/communication/communicating)

### [Collaborating](https://curriculum.gov.bc.ca/competencies/communication/collaborating)

Communicating encompasses the set of abilities that people use to impart and exchange information, experiences, and ideas; to explore the world around them; and to understand and effectively use communication forms, strategies, and technologies. Communicating provides a bridge between peoples' learning, their personal and social identity, and the world in which they interact.

Collaborating involves the skills, strategies, and dispositions that people use to work together to pursue common purposes and accomplish common goals.

People who communicate effectively use their skills and strategies intentionally to ensure understanding their audience. They communicate in an increasing variety of contexts, for a variety of purposes, and often with multiple audiences.

People who collaborate effectively recognize how combining others' perspectives, strategies, and efforts with their own enhances collective understanding, use, and impact. They value the contributions of group members, interact supportively and effectively using inclusive practices, and strive for shared commitment and mutual benefit.

The Thinking Core Competency has two interrelated sub-competencies:

### [Creative Thinking](https://curriculum.gov.bc.ca/competencies/thinking/creative-thinking)

### [Critical and Reflective Thinking](https://curriculum.gov.bc.ca/competencies/thinking/critical-and-reflective-thinking)

Creative Thinking involves the generation of ideas and concepts that are novel and innovative in the context in which they are generated, reflection on their value to the individual or others, and the development of chosen ideas and concepts from thought to reality.

Critical and Reflective Thinking encompasses a set of abilities that students use to examine their own thinking and that of others. This involves making judgments based on reasoning, where students consider options, analyze options using specific criteria, and draw conclusions.

People who think creatively are curious and open-minded, have a sense of wonder and joy in learning, demonstrate a willingness to think divergently, and are comfortable with complexity. A creative thinker reflects on existing ideas and concepts; uses imagination, inventiveness, resourcefulness, and flexibility; and is willing to take risks to go beyond existing knowledge.

People who think critically and reflectively are analytical and investigative, willing to question and challenge their own thoughts, ideas, and assumptions and challenge those of others. They reflect on the information they receive through observation, experience, and other forms of communication to solve problems, design products, understand events, and address issues. A critical thinker uses their ideas, experiences, and reflections to set goals, make judgments, and refine their thinking.

### [Personal and Social](https://curriculum.gov.bc.ca/competencies/thinking)

- **Definition**

> The Personal and Social competency is the set of abilities that relate to students' identity in the world, both as individuals and as members of their community and society. Personal and Social competency encompasses what students need to thrive as individuals, to understand and care about themselves and others, and to find and achieve their purposes in the world.

The Personal and Social Core Competency has three interrelated sub-competencies:

### [Personal Awareness and Responsibility](https://curriculum.gov.bc.ca/competencies/personal-and-social/personal-awareness-and-responsibility)

### [Positive Personal and Cultural Identity](https://curriculum.gov.bc.ca/competencies/personal-and-social/positive-personal-and-cultural-identity)

### [Social Awareness and Responsibility](https://curriculum.gov.bc.ca/competencies/personal-and-social/social-awareness-and-responsibility)

Personal Awareness and Responsibility involves understanding the connections between personal and social behaviour and well-being; it encourages people to make constructive and ethical decisions and act on them.

Positive Personal and Cultural Identity involves the awareness, understanding, and appreciation of the factors that contribute to a healthy sense of oneself; it includes knowledge of one's family background, heritage(s), language(s), beliefs, and perspectives in a pluralistic society.

Social Awareness and Responsibility involves the awareness, understanding, and appreciation of connections among people, including between people and the natural environment. Social Awareness and Responsibility focuses on interacting with others and the natural world in respectful and caring ways.

People who are personally aware and responsible demonstrate self-respect, persevere in difficult situations, and exercise responsibility. They understand that there are consequences for their decisions and actions. A personally aware and responsible individual takes steps to ensure their well-being, sets goals and monitors progress, regulates emotions and manages stress, and recognizes and advocates for their own rights.

People who have a positive personal and cultural identity value their personal and cultural narratives and understand how these shape their identity. They exhibit a sense of self-worth, self-awareness, and positive identity to become confident individuals who take satisfaction in who they are and what they can do. They contribute to their own well-being and to the well-being of their family, community, and society.

People who are socially aware and responsible contribute to the well-being of their social and physical environments. They support the development of welcoming and inclusive communities, where people feel safe and have a sense of belonging.

A socially aware and responsible individual contributes positively to their family, community, and environment; empathizes with others and appreciates their perspectives; resolves problems peacefully; and develops and sustains healthy relationships.
