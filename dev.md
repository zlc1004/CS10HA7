# Cybersecurity | CS10HA7 Part B

## New Technology

### What is cybersecurity all about?

Cybersecurity is the practice of protecting systems, networks, and programs from digital attacks. These cyberattacks are usually aimed at accessing, changing, or destroying sensitive information; extorting money from users through ransomware; or interrupting normal business processes.

Implementing effective cybersecurity measures is particularly challenging today because there are more devices than people, and attackers are becoming more innovative.

A successful cybersecurity posture has multiple layers of protection spread across the computers, networks, programs, or data that one intends to keep safe. In an organization, a unified threat management gateway system can automate integrations across products and accelerate key security operations functions: detection, investigation, and remediation. People, processes, and technology must all complement one another to create an effective defense from cyberattacks.

#### People

Users must understand and comply with basic data protection and privacy security principles like choosing strong passwords, being wary of attachments in email, and backing up data.

#### Processes

Organizations must have a framework for how they deal with both attempted and successful cyberattacks, like installing antivirus, and backing up data.

### Why is cybersecurity important?

At an individual level, a cybersecurity attack can result in everything from identity theft to extortion attempts, to the loss of important data like family photos. Everyone relies on critical infrastructure like power plants, hospitals, and financial service companies. Securing these and other organizations is essential to keeping our society functioning.

### Impact on Society

Cybersecurity is crucial for protecting sensitive information, maintaining privacy, and ensuring the integrity of systems and networks. As technology continues to advance, the potential for cyber threats increases, making cybersecurity a top priority for individuals, businesses, and governments alike.
Cybersecurity is essential for safeguarding personal data, financial information, and critical infrastructure from cyberattacks. It helps prevent identity theft, data breaches, and cybercrime, ensuring the safety and privacy of individuals and organizations. In an increasingly interconnected world, effective cybersecurity measures are vital for maintaining trust in digital systems and protecting against evolving threats.

## Historical Content

### History of Computing

C++ ( pronounced "C plus plus" and sometimes abbreviated as CPP) is a high-level, general-purpose programming language created by Danish computer scientist Bjarne Stroustrup. First released in 1985 as an extension of the C programming language, it has since expanded significantly over time; as of 1997, C++ has object-oriented, generic, and functional features, in addition to facilities for low-level memory manipulation for systems like microcomputers or to make operating systems like Linux or Windows. It is usually implemented as a compiled language, and many vendors provide C++ compilers, including the Free Software Foundation, LLVM, Microsoft, Intel, Embarcadero, Oracle, and IBM. The language first appeared in 1985, 40 years ago, and is still updated to this day. C++ significantly contributes to software development through its high performance, and influence on syntax design of other coding languages. It's widely used in system programming, game development, and high-performance applications, and allows precise control over memory and resources. C++ also influenced the design of other popular languages like Java, C#, and Python.

History:

C with Classes
For his work at AT&T Bell Labs, Stroustrup decided to enhance the C programming language with language features like those he found so useful. The new language was initially simply named, "C with Classes."

C++ 1986
added
Virtual functions
Function name and operator overloading
References
Const
User-controlled free-store memory control
Improved type checking and C++ style comments

C++ Release 2.0 1989
added
Multiple inheritance
Type-safe linkage
Improved resolution of overloaded functions
Recursive definition of assignment and initialization
Improved facilities for user-defined memory management
Abstract classes
Static member functions
Const member functions
Protected members
Overloading of operator -> and pointers to members.

C++ Release 3.0 1991
This was the final C++ version before the language was standardized.
C++ 3.0 added class and function templates.

Real-time Type Information (RTTI): Provided dynamic_cast and typeid, allowing safe type conversions and identification at runtime.
Bool Type: Added a native boolean type (bool) for clearer and safer conditional expressions with true/false values.
Covariant Return Types: Enabled derived class methods to override base class methods with more specific return types, enhancing polymorphism.
Cast Operators: Introduced user-defined casting operators, giving classes the ability to define custom conversion logic.
Mutable Members: Allowed certain members of const objects to be modified by marking them as mutable, providing flexibility in const-correctness scenarios.
Member Templates: Enabled class members to be declared as templates, supporting generic programming at the member level for more versatile code reuse.

C++03 2003
maintenance release of c++98

C++11 2011
This new version introduced many new major features.

Concurrency: Added support for multi-threading with threads, mutexes, and atomic operations.
Move Semantics and Rvalue References: Enabled efficient object transfers to reduce unnecessary copying.
Auto and decltype: Simplified type inference and declaration in C++ programs.
Lambda Expressions: Provided a concise way to define anonymous functions inline.
Uniform Initialization: Standardized initialization syntax with braces {} for various types.
nullptr: Introduced a type-safe null pointer constant, replacing NULL or 0.
Strongly-typed Enums (enum classes): Enhanced enum safety and scope control.

C++14
alteration of major and minor releases of C++11

C++17

After the minor C++14 release, C++17 should have been a major update. Unfortunately some major features planned for this update, were not added this version.

Inline Variables: Enabled inline variable definitions in headers, facilitating easy sharing of constants without linker errors.
Fold Expressions: Simplified expressions involving parameter packs by reducing them to a single value using operators like + or -.
Guaranteed Copy Elision: Optimized performance by eliminating unnecessary copy and move operations during object creation.
If Constexpr: Enabled compile-time branching with if constexpr, allowing conditional compilation based on constant expressions for more efficient template metaprogramming.
Standard Attributes: Introduced attributes like [[nodiscard]] and [[deprecated]] to help catch common mistakes and improve code quality.

C++20
The major features that did not make it in C++17 were added in C++20.
The major new language features are:
Coroutines
Concepts
Modules
