        What is cybersecurity all about?
      </h3>

      <p>
        Cybersecurity is the practice of protecting systems, networks, and
        programs from digital attacks. These cyberattacks are usually aimed at
        accessing, changing, or destroying sensitive information; extorting
        money from users through ransomware; or interrupting normal business
        processes.
      </p>

      <p>
        Implementing effective cybersecurity measures is particularly
        challenging today because there are more devices than people, and
        attackers are becoming more innovative.
      </p>

      <p>
        A successful cybersecurity posture has multiple layers of protection
        spread across the computers, networks, programs, or data that one
        intends to keep safe. In an organization, a unified threat management
        gateway system can automate integrations across products and accelerate
        key security operations functions: detection, investigation, and
        remediation. People, processes, and technology must all complement one
        another to create an effective defense from cyberattacks.
      </p>

      <h4 id="people">People</h4>

      <p>
        Users must understand and comply with basic data protection and privacy
        security principles like choosing strong passwords, being wary of
        attachments in email, and backing up data.
      </p>

      <h4 id="processes">Processes</h4>

      <p>
        Organizations must have a framework for how they deal with both
        attempted and successful cyberattacks, like installing antivirus, and
        backing up data.
      </p>

      <h3 id="why-is-cybersecurity-important">
        Why is cybersecurity important?
      </h3>

      <p>
        At an individual level, a cybersecurity attack can result in everything
        from identity theft to extortion attempts, to the loss of important data
        like family photos. Everyone relies on critical infrastructure like
        power plants, hospitals, and financial service companies. Securing these
        and other organizations is essential to keeping our society functioning.

      <h2 id="core-competencies">Core Competencies</h2>

      <p>
        The Core Competencies are sets of intellectual, personal, and social and
        emotional proficiencies that all students need in order to engage in
        deep, lifelong learning. Along with literacy and numeracy foundations,
        they are central to British Columbia’s K-12 curriculum and assessment
        system and directly support students in their growth as educated
        citizens.
      </p>

      <p>
        Students develop Core Competencies when they are engaged in the “doing”
        - the Curricular Competencies - within a learning area. As such, they
        are an integral part of the curriculum. While they manifest themselves
        uniquely in each area of learning, the Core Competencies are often
        interconnected and are foundational to all learning.
      </p>

      <p>
        Before students enter school, development of Core Competencies begins at
        home and then continues throughout their life. Students encounter
        opportunities to develop their competence in formal and informal
        settings. They move from demonstrating competence in relatively simple
        and highly supported situations, to demonstrating independence in more
        complex and varied contexts. Competency development does not end with
        school graduation but continues in personal, social, educational, and
        workplace contexts.
      </p>

      <p>
        Students, teachers, and parents/guardians share responsibility for the
        ongoing development of Core Competencies. Each group has its own
        considerations.

      <ul>
        <li>
          Discussing the Core Competencies with peers, teachers, and family can
          deepen students’ understanding of the Core Competencies and help them
          identify personal strengths and establish goals for further
          development as educated citizens
        </li>
        <li>
          Examining the illustrations helps students develop an appreciation of
          the different ways, forms, and contexts in which the Core Competencies
          can be applied
        </li>
        <li>
          The illustrations connect the Core Competencies with students’ own
          classroom experiences and bring the profiles to life for them
        </li>
        <li>
          <p>
            Students are responsible for assessing their own growth in the Core
            Competencies. The profiles linked with each sub-competency can serve
            as a helpful guide in this self-assessment
          </p>
        </li>
        <li>
          Teachers can use the sub-competency profiles and illustrations to
          support students in their growth as educated citizens
        </li>
        <li>
          Providing students with meaningful tasks and activities, where they
          can explicitly reflect on where and how they are using the Core
          Competencies, will further their development in Communication,
          Thinking, and Personal and Social. The illustrations for each
          sub-competency provide examples of rich tasks, activities, and
          feedback
        </li>
        <li>
          The Core Competencies are embedded within the curriculum and are
          naturally supported when students engage with the Big Ideas and
          Curricular Competencies in each area of learning. Examples of explicit
          connections with Big Ideas can be found in the “Connection” section
          for each sub-competency
        </li>
        <li>
          <p>
            Teachers support students in assessing their own growth in the Core
            Competencies. (For more information on assessment and the Core
            Competencies, please see
            <a href="https://curriculum.gov.bc.ca/classroom-assessment"
              >Classroom Assessment and Reporting</a
            >)
          </p>
        </li>
        <li>
          Students develop Core Competencies at home as well as at school,
          making parent/guardian support for students’ growing awareness,
          understanding, and development of the Core Competencies crucial
        </li>
        <li>
          Parents/guardians will likely already have some understanding of their
          students’ development in Communication, Thinking, and Personal and
          Social
        </li>
        <li>
          Formal school tasks and activities often look different from the more
          informal tasks students are involved in at home. While both contexts
          are valuable, parents/guardians can expect that a student’s use of the
          Core Competencies may look very different in these two contexts
        </li>
        <li>
          The illustrations offer examples from a variety of contexts and can
          provide parents/guardians with a new lens through which to view their
          students’ development as educated citizens

      <p>
        The Communication competency encompasses the knowledge, skills,
        processes and dispositions we associate with interactions with others.
        Through their communication, students acquire, develop and transform
        ideas and information, and make connections with others to share their
        ideas, express their individuality, further their learning, and get
        things done. The communication competency is fundamental to finding
        satisfaction, purpose and joy.
      </p>

      <p>
        The Thinking competency encompasses the knowledge, skills and processes
        we associate with intellectual development. It is through their
        competency as thinkers that students take subject-specific concepts and
        content and transform them into a new understanding. Thinking competence
        includes specific thinking skills as well as habits of mind, and
        metacognitive awareness. These are used to process information from a
        variety of sources, including thoughts and feelings that arise from the
        subconscious and unconscious mind and from embodied cognition, to create
        new understandings.
      </p>

      <p>
        The Personal and Social competency is the set of abilities that relate
        to students’ identity in the world, both as individuals and as members
        of their community and society. Personal and social competency
        encompasses what students need to thrive as individuals, to understand
        and care about themselves and others, and to find and achieve their
        purposes in the world.

      <p>
        Communicating encompasses the set of abilities that people use to impart
        and exchange information, experiences, and ideas; to explore the world
        around them; and to understand and effectively use communication forms,
        strategies, and technologies. Communicating provides a bridge between
        peoples’ learning, their personal and social identity, and the world in
        which they interact.
      </p>

      <p>
        Collaborating involves the skills, strategies, and dispositions that
        people use to work together to pursue common purposes and accomplish
        common goals.
      </p>

      <p>
        People who communicate effectively use their skills and strategies
        intentionally to ensure understanding their audience. They communicate
        in an increasing variety of contexts, for a variety of purposes, and
        often with multiple audiences.
      </p>

      <p>
        People who collaborate effectively recognize how combining others’
        perspectives, strategies, and efforts with their own enhances collective
        understanding, use, and impact. They value the contributions of group
        members, interact supportively and effectively using inclusive
        practices, and strive for shared commitment and mutual benefit.

      </h3>

      <p>
        Creative Thinking involves the generation of ideas and concepts that are
        novel and innovative in the context in which they are generated,
        reflection on their value to the individual or others, and the
        development of chosen ideas and concepts from thought to reality.
      </p>

      <p>
        Critical and Reflective Thinking encompasses a set of abilities that
        students use to examine their own thinking and that of others. This
        involves making judgments based on reasoning, where students consider
        options, analyze options using specific criteria, and draw conclusions.
      </p>

      <p>
        People who think creatively are curious and open-minded, have a sense of
        wonder and joy in learning, demonstrate a willingness to think
        divergently, and are comfortable with complexity. A creative thinker
        reflects on existing ideas and concepts; uses imagination,
        inventiveness, resourcefulness, and flexibility; and is willing to take
        risks to go beyond existing knowledge.
      </p>

      <p>
        People who think critically and reflectively are analytical and
        investigative, willing to question and challenge their own thoughts,
        ideas, and assumptions and challenge those of others. They reflect on
        the information they receive through observation, experience, and other
        forms of communication to solve problems, design products, understand
        events, and address issues. A critical thinker uses their ideas,
        experiences, and reflections to set goals, make judgments, and refine
        their thinking.

      </h3>

      <p>
        Personal Awareness and Responsibility involves understanding the
        connections between personal and social behaviour and well-being; it
        encourages people to make constructive and ethical decisions and act on
        them.
      </p>

      <p>
        Positive Personal and Cultural Identity involves the awareness,
        understanding, and appreciation of the factors that contribute to a
        healthy sense of oneself; it includes knowledge of one’s family
        background, heritage(s), language(s), beliefs, and perspectives in a
        pluralistic society.
      </p>

      <p>
        Social Awareness and Responsibility involves the awareness,
        understanding, and appreciation of connections among people, including
        between people and the natural environment. Social Awareness and
        Responsibility focuses on interacting with others and the natural world
        in respectful and caring ways.
      </p>

      <p>
        People who are personally aware and responsible demonstrate
        self-respect, persevere in difficult situations, and exercise
        responsibility. They understand that there are consequences for their
        decisions and actions. A personally aware and responsible individual

        People who have a positive personal and cultural identity value their
        personal and cultural narratives and understand how these shape their
        identity. They exhibit a sense of self-worth, self-awareness, and
        positive identity to become confident individuals who take satisfaction
        in who they are and what they can do. They contribute to their own
        well-being and to the well-being of their family, community, and
        society.
