        What is cybersecurity all about?
      </h3>

      <p>
        Cybersecurity is the practice of protecting systems, networks, and
        programs from digital attacks. These cyberattacks are usually aimed at
        accessing, changing, or destroying sensitive information; extorting
        money from users through ransomware; or interrupting normal business
        processes.
      </p>

      <p>
        Implementing effective cybersecurity measures is particularly
        challenging today because there are more devices than people, and
        attackers are becoming more innovative.
      </p>

      <p>
        A successful cybersecurity posture has multiple layers of protection
        spread across the computers, networks, programs, or data that one
        intends to keep safe. In an organization, a unified threat management
        gateway system can automate integrations across products and accelerate
        key security operations functions: detection, investigation, and
        remediation. People, processes, and technology must all complement one
        another to create an effective defense from cyberattacks.
      </p>

      <h4 id="people">People</h4>

      <p>
        Users must understand and comply with basic data protection and privacy
        security principles like choosing strong passwords, being wary of
        attachments in email, and backing up data.
      </p>

      <h4 id="processes">Processes</h4>

      <p>
        Organizations must have a framework for how they deal with both
        attempted and successful cyberattacks, like installing antivirus, and
        backing up data.
      </p>

      <h3 id="why-is-cybersecurity-important">
        Why is cybersecurity important?
      </h3>

      <p>
        At an individual level, a cybersecurity attack can result in everything
        from identity theft to extortion attempts, to the loss of important data
        like family photos. Everyone relies on critical infrastructure like
        power plants, hospitals, and financial service companies. Securing these
        and other organizations is essential to keeping our society functioning.
      </p>

      <h3 id="impact-on-society">Impact on Society</h3>

      <p>
        Cybersecurity is crucial for protecting sensitive information,
        maintaining privacy, and ensuring the integrity of systems and networks.
        As technology continues to advance, the potential for cyber threats
        increases, making cybersecurity a top priority for individuals,
        businesses, and governments alike. Cybersecurity is essential for
        safeguarding personal data, financial information, and critical
        infrastructure from cyberattacks. It helps prevent identity theft, data
        breaches, and cybercrime, ensuring the safety and privacy of individuals
        and organizations. In an increasingly interconnected world, effective
        cybersecurity measures are vital for maintaining trust in digital
        systems and protecting against evolving threats.

      <p>
        C++ ( pronounced “C plus plus” and sometimes abbreviated as CPP) is a
        high-level, general-purpose programming language created by Danish
        computer scientist Bjarne Stroustrup. First released in 1985 as an
        extension of the C programming language, it has since expanded
        significantly over time; as of 1997, C++ has object-oriented, generic,
        and functional features, in addition to facilities for low-level memory
        manipulation for systems like microcomputers or to make operating
        systems like Linux or Windows. It is usually implemented as a compiled
        language, and many vendors provide C++ compilers, including the Free
        Software Foundation, LLVM, Microsoft, Intel, Embarcadero, Oracle, and
        IBM. The language first appeared in 1985, 40 years ago, and is still
        updated to this day. C++ significantly contributes to software
        development through its high performance, and influence on syntax design
        of other coding languages. It’s widely used in system programming, game
        development, and high-performance applications, and allows precise
        control over memory and resources. C++ also influenced the design of
        other popular languages like Java, C#, and Python.
      </p>

      <p>History:</p>

      <p>
        C with Classes For his work at AT&amp;T Bell Labs, Stroustrup decided to
        enhance the C programming language with language features like those he
        found so useful. The new language was initially simply named, “C with
        Classes.”
      </p>

      <p>
        C++ 1986 added Virtual functions Function name and operator overloading
        References Const User-controlled free-store memory control Improved type
        checking and C++ style comments
      </p>

      <p>
        C++ Release 2.0 1989 added Multiple inheritance Type-safe linkage
        Improved resolution of overloaded functions Recursive definition of
        assignment and initialization Improved facilities for user-defined
        memory management Abstract classes Static member functions Const member
        functions Protected members Overloading of operator -&gt; and pointers
        to members.
      </p>

      <p>
        C++ Release 3.0 1991 This was the final C++ version before the language
        was standardized. C++ 3.0 added class and function templates.
      </p>

      <p>
        Real-time Type Information (RTTI): Provided dynamic_cast and typeid,
        allowing safe type conversions and identification at runtime. Bool Type:
        Added a native boolean type (bool) for clearer and safer conditional
        expressions with true/false values. Covariant Return Types: Enabled
        derived class methods to override base class methods with more specific
        return types, enhancing polymorphism. Cast Operators: Introduced
        user-defined casting operators, giving classes the ability to define
        custom conversion logic. Mutable Members: Allowed certain members of
        const objects to be modified by marking them as mutable, providing
        flexibility in const-correctness scenarios. Member Templates: Enabled
        class members to be declared as templates, supporting generic
        programming at the member level for more versatile code reuse.
      </p>

      <p>C++03 2003 maintenance release of c++98</p>

      <p>C++11 2011 This new version introduced many new major features.</p>

      <p>
        Concurrency: Added support for multi-threading with threads, mutexes,
        and atomic operations. Move Semantics and Rvalue References: Enabled
        efficient object transfers to reduce unnecessary copying. Auto and
        decltype: Simplified type inference and declaration in C++ programs.
        Lambda Expressions: Provided a concise way to define anonymous functions
        inline. Uniform Initialization: Standardized initialization syntax with
        braces {} for various types. nullptr: Introduced a type-safe null
        pointer constant, replacing NULL or 0. Strongly-typed Enums (enum
        classes): Enhanced enum safety and scope control.
      </p>

      <p>C++14 alteration of major and minor releases of C++11</p>

      <p>C++17</p>

      <p>
        After the minor C++14 release, C++17 should have been a major update.
        Unfortunately some major features planned for this update, were not
        added this version.
      </p>

      <p>
        Inline Variables: Enabled inline variable definitions in headers,
        facilitating easy sharing of constants without linker errors. Fold
        Expressions: Simplified expressions involving parameter packs by
        reducing them to a single value using operators like + or -. Guaranteed
        Copy Elision: Optimized performance by eliminating unnecessary copy and
        move operations during object creation. If Constexpr: Enabled
        compile-time branching with if constexpr, allowing conditional
        compilation based on constant expressions for more efficient template
        metaprogramming. Standard Attributes: Introduced attributes like
        [[nodiscard]] and [[deprecated]] to help catch common mistakes and
        improve code quality.
      </p>

      <p>
        C++20 The major features that did not make it in C++17 were added in
        C++20. The major new language features are: Coroutines Concepts Modules

        The First Website is Still Online
      </h3>

      <p>
        The very first website ever created is still accessible today, serving
        as a digital relic from the early days of the internet. It was launched
        on August 6, 1991, by Tim Berners-Lee, the inventor of the World Wide
        Web. Berners-Lee, a British scientist working at CERN (the European
        Organization for Nuclear Research), developed the World Wide Web to
        facilitate information sharing among scientists and researchers across
        different institutions and countries.
      </p>

      <p>
        The original website, hosted at
        <a href="http://info.cern.ch">info.cern.ch</a>, was a simple text page
        that provided an explanation of the World Wide Web project. It included
        instructions on how to create web pages, use hypertext, and navigate the
        new information system. The site also contained links to other web
        servers, making it a valuable resource for early web users to explore
        and understand this groundbreaking technology.
      </p>

      <p>
        Over the years, the website has been preserved in its original form,
        offering a fascinating glimpse into the nascent stages of the internet.
        Visiting the site today allows users to see the minimalistic design and
        basic HTML coding that characterized the early web. The preservation of
        this website underscores the rapid evolution of web technology,
        highlighting how far we have come from those early days of simple text
        pages to the complex, interactive websites we use today.
      </p>

      <p>
        Tim Berners-Lee’s creation of the World Wide Web was a pivotal moment in
        the history of the internet, transforming it from a tool for academic
        and military communication into a global information network accessible
        to anyone with a computer. The first website stands as a testament to
        this revolutionary innovation, reminding us of the humble beginnings of
        the web and its extraordinary impact on the world.
